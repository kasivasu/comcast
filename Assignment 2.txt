Assignment 2 - Pandas - When is my server busy? Mon, Tue, Wed / 1 PM, 2PM , 3 PM ...etc???

Read the file - Server Request.csv

Convert the datetime field which is currently in character to a python datetime column
There is a function called pd.to_datetime() which will take a pandas column and convert to a 
datetime column (it will automatically determine input format)

Remove nulls in the data using pandas dropna() function

Add 2 new columns - WeekDay (should have the format 1-Mon, 2-Tue), HourofDay column

Pivot the resultant data based on WeekDay and HourofDay, values = serverrequests 
and aggfunc='mean'


use seaborn to plot the data
